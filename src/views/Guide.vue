    <div style="position: absolute; top: 10vh; text-align: left; font-size: 3vh">This card game is played on a best of 3 format, where rounds are won by the player with the highest points on that round after both players pass. The points are a sum of the health points of all the units on your side of the board.</div>
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 25vh; text-align: left; font-size: 3vh">Passing in a round stops you from playing any more cards in that round, it's a good way to save some of your best cards for the later rounds</div>
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; text-align: left; font-size: 3vh">Before the start of each round you enter a redraw phase where you can choose up to 2 cards from your hand to shuffle into your deck and then draw as many as you shuffled, you can also keep your hand as is. You also draw 2 cards at the end of each round.</div>
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 55vh; text-align: left; font-size: 3vh">Most cards have abilities, some of which reapply at the end of every turn, some of these however require certain conditions to be met, read the card descriptions to make sure you use them effectively.</div>
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 70vh; text-align: left; font-size: 3vh">Some cards can apply statusses to other units, there are 4 statusses that can be applied to a unit, the effect of a status is displayed on the card description whenever that card can apply that status.</div>
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 85vh; text-align: left; font-size: 3vh">Note: I recommend playing fullscreen so the objects don't intersect.</div>
